# SWAP BZL to REAK

A swap back-end for BZLcoin. 
 

It can be used by any other currency that wants to swap.
This system is only used to receive the coins, but the sending of tokens is not included.

If you wish, it can be implemented by yourself.

## Getting Started

To manually install all of the necessary components, you can run these commands:

cd swap_bzl_reak
yarn install
yarn run start


## Operation.

The basic idea is:
1. Receive the coins that will be exchanged.
2. Provide real-time consultation of received values based on the blockchain.
3. Automatically send the new coins to the registered address (not implemented).

## Note

This system is not complete, use at your own risk.
